# Recurrent-Neural-Networks-using-Python
A recurrent neural network is a type of artificial neural network commonly used in speech recognition and natural language processing. Recurrent neural networks recognize data's sequential characteristics and use patterns to predict the next likely scenario.
Recurrent means the output at the current time step becomes the input to the next time step. At each element of the sequence, the model considers not just the current input, but what it remembers about the preceding elements.
